# AskWiki Summary
In this project we sought to improve the quesiton and answering capabilities of large language models such as ChatGPT.
Our goal was to enhance these models by enabling them to query information from knowledge graphs such as WikiData thus reducing their tendancy to "hallucinate"
and granting them access to up-to-date information that they may previously have not been trained on.
