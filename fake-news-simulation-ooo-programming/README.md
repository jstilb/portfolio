# Fake News Simulation Project
This project is an object-oriented design project, in which I simulate fake dissemination with the goal of giving users a way to understand how dangerous information can spread.

## Files

This document contains details about the simulation design including descriptions of the classes used and their attributes/methods.

### requirements.txt
This is a list of requirements and dependencies needed to run the project on a given machin.

### simulation_flow_diagram.pdf
This is a visual flow chart that describes how the simulation works in an easy to interpret manner.
