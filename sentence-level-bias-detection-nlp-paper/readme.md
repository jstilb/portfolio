# Summary
In this project, I reviewed existing methods for sentence-level bias detection and sough to improve upon current standards of performance using DeBERTa. 
The code is available as well as my research findings, but the dataset BABE and model of DeBERTA will need to be accessed via github and huggingface respectively.
