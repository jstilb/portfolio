# Covid Hypothesis Testing Project
This project was a group project in which my team and I answered several research questions regarding Covid-19 using recent election survey data.


## Overview
The American National Election Studies (ANES) conducts surveys of voters in the United States, with a
flagship survey occurring immediately before and after each presidential election. While the post-election
data for 2020 is not yet available, pre-election data is available as a preliminary release. In this lab, you will
use the ANES data to answer questions about voters in the US. This project consists of three research questions. For each question, our team conducted a statistical analysis and generated a written report in pdf format.

## Data
Data for the lab should be drawn from the 2020 American National Election Studies (ANES). You can access
this data at https://electionstudies.org. This is the official site of the ANES, a project that has been ongoing
since 1948, and federally funded by the National Science Foundation since 1977.
To access the data, you will need to register for an account, confirm this account, and then login. The data
that you need should come from the 2020 Time Series Study.
You will note that there are two forms of data that are available, data that is stored in a .dta format, and
data that is stored in a .sav format. Both of these are proprietary data formats (.dta for STATA, and .sav
for SPSS).
While you’re at the ANES website, you will also want to download the codebook, because all of the variables
are marked as something like, V200002 – which isn’t very descriptive without the codebook.
For a glimpse into some of the intricacies that go into the design of this study, take a look at the introduction
to the codebook.
Like many modern surveys, the ANES includes survey weights, which are used to correct for differences
between how frequently demographic groups appear in the sample compared to the US population (often ultimately relying on US census data).

## The Research Questions
The research question for each of the three parts of the project are as follows:
1. Are Democratic voters older or younger than Republican voters in 2020?
2. Did Democratic voters or Republican voters report experiencing more difficulty voting in the 2020
election?
3. Are people who believe that science is is important for making government decisions about COVID-19
more likely to disapprove of the way their governor is handling the pandemic?

## Files

### anes_timeseries_2020_stata_20210324.dta
A .dta file containing the election survey data. More information about the data can be found above in the "Data" section.

### Question 1
There are two files pertaining to question 1: a pdf and rmd file. The PDF is the output file in a structured report. It excludes info unnecessary to the report such as some of the data prep and R code. The rmd file contains all information used to generate said report and the aforementioned excluded information.

### Question 2
There are two files pertaining to question 2: a pdf and rmd file. The PDF is the output file in a structured report. It excludes info unnecessary to the report such as some of the data prep and R code. The rmd file contains all information used to generate said report and the aforementioned excluded information.

### Question 3
There are two files pertaining to question 3: a pdf and rmd file. The PDF is the output file in a structured report. It excludes info unnecessary to the report such as some of the data prep and R code. The rmd file contains all information used to generate said report and the aforementioned excluded information.
