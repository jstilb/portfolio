## Phase 1: Quick Wins (Week 1)

**Goal:** Clean, professional GitHub presence in 5 days.

| Day | Task | Deliverable |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | Create `jstilb/jstilb` profile repo with README | Profile README live on GitHub |
| 1 | Archive `portfolio` and `W207-Applied-Machine-Learning` | Clean repo list |
| 1 | Pin `meaningful_metrics`, add topic tags | Discoverable showcase repo |
| 2 | Add LICENSE, CI workflow, badges to `meaningful_metrics` | Professional repo standards |
| 3 | Add Dockerfile to `meaningful_metrics` | Reproducibility |
| 4 | Add worked example notebook to `meaningful_metrics` | Demonstrates metrics in action |
| 5 | Polish GitHub profile (bio, location, status) | Complete first impression |

**Exit Criteria:** Profile looks professional and active. `meaningful_metrics` scores 22+/25 on audit rubric.

## Phase 2: First Gap Projects (Week 2-3)

**Goal:** Launch 2 high-impact projects that close the most critical skill gaps.

### Project 1: RAG Knowledge Base (Week 2)
- Closes: RAG, Vector DBs, Embeddings, Context Engineering (4 HIGH gaps)
- Spec: `specs/01-rag-knowledge-base.md`
- Approach: Build via PAI autowork, leveraging existing Claude API access
- Deliverable: Public repo with working RAG system, documentation, and demo

### Project 2: LLM Agent Framework (Week 3)
- Closes: Agentic Orchestration, MCP, Compound AI Systems (surfaces private expertise)
- Spec: `specs/02-llm-agent-framework.md`
- Approach: Extract patterns from PAI into public-safe framework
- Deliverable: Public repo with agent framework, examples, and tests

**Exit Criteria:** 2 new repos live, each with README, tests, CI, and LICENSE.

## Phase 3: Complete Core Portfolio (Week 4-8)

**Goal:** Build remaining priority projects to reach 78/100 portfolio score.

### Week 4-5: ML Pipeline Toolkit
- Closes: MLOps, Data Engineering, CI/CD, Model Serving (3 HIGH gaps)
- Spec: `specs/03-ml-pipeline-toolkit.md`
- Focus: End-to-end pipeline from data ingestion to model serving

### Week 5-7: Deep Learning NLP Project
- Closes: Deep Learning, NLP, Transformers, Fine-tuning (3 HIGH gaps)
- Spec: `specs/04-deep-learning-nlp.md`
- Focus: Transformer-based NLP with fine-tuning and evaluation

### Week 7-8: AI Observability Dashboard
- Closes: AI Observability, Monitoring (unique differentiator)
- Spec: `specs/05-ai-observability-dashboard.md`
- Focus: Real-time monitoring for LLM applications

**Exit Criteria:** 5 total new repos. Portfolio score reaches 78/100. All Tier 2 HIGH gaps closed.

---

## Phase 4: Ongoing Maintenance

**Goal:** Keep portfolio active, professional, and current.

### Weekly
- Commit to at least 1 repo (maintain green contribution graph)
- Review and respond to any Issues or Discussions

### Monthly
- Update profile README with new projects
- Refresh topic tags for SEO
- Review repos against job postings for relevance

### Quarterly
- Re-run portfolio audit (use this report's rubric)
- Evaluate new skill gaps from market trends
- Plan next project based on gaps

### As Needed
- Add Priority 2 projects (Experiment Tracker, Prompt Engineering Toolkit, Data Viz)
- Add Priority 3 projects (AI Safety Red Team, Multi-Modal Pipeline)
- Write blog posts linking to projects (technical writeups increase visibility)

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Projects take longer than estimated | Focus on MVP scope first, enhance later |
| Autowork quality issues | Manual review before each repo goes public |
| Market shifts (new tools/frameworks) | Quarterly audit catches emerging requirements |
| Burnout from parallel projects | Max 1 active project at a time, use autowork |
| Private PAI patterns leaking | Strict review before any code goes public |
