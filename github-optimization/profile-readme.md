# Hi, I'm Jm Stilb

**Data Scientist & AI Engineer** building intelligent systems at the intersection of machine learning and production AI.

---

## About Me

I design and build AI systems that solve real problems -- from evaluation frameworks that measure what matters to production pipelines that scale. My work spans traditional machine learning foundations through modern AI engineering: RAG systems, agentic orchestration, LLM evaluation, and context engineering.

Currently based in **San Diego, CA** and open to **Data Scientist** and **AI Engineer** opportunities.

## What I'm Building

- **Human-centered AI evaluation** -- frameworks and playbooks for measuring AI system quality beyond accuracy scores
- **Production AI infrastructure** -- multi-agent systems, RAG pipelines, and context engineering at scale
- **Open-source tools** -- contributing evaluation frameworks and governance templates to the AI community

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| [meaningful_metrics](https://github.com/jstilb/meaningful_metrics) | Open-source evaluation frameworks for human-centered metrics, AI evaluation playbooks, and governance templates | Python, LLM Evaluation, Responsible AI |

*More projects launching soon -- building portfolio coverage across deep learning, RAG systems, agent frameworks, and production MLOps.*
